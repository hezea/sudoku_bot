# Sudoku recognition and solving

## About

A little application made for the first semester "Project Practice" course.
Was only tested on Linux, other platforms probably wont't work.

## Linux usage

1. Clone the repository with

    `git clone https://github.com/hezea/sudoku_bot.git`

2. Open repository folder:

    `cd sudoku_bot`

3. Set up virtual environment:

    `./setup.sh`

    1. It *might* be necessary to change permissions of the executables first:

        `chmod u+x setup.sh`

        `chmod u+x run.sh`

4. Run the application:

    `./run.sh`

## To-do

1. Telegram integration
2. Cutting sudoku into pieces
3. ~~This is my last resort~~
    
    3.1 Digit recognition

4. Simple recursive solver
